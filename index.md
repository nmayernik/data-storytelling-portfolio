I'm Nick Mayernik, a freelance UX Designer & Researcher interested in building meaningful digital interactions. I'm also a senior Psychology student at [Lafayette College](http://lafayette.edu), where I study the cognitive models underlying positive user experience.

This summer, I'm taking COMM-165: Data Storytelling at Lehigh, and this is where I'll share my progress.
